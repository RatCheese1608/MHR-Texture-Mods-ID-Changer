# MHR-Texture-Mods-ID-Changer
A simple batch to do the tedious changes for texture mods.

It's to be used on the Lucina texture mods for MHR ([this one](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/1237) and [this one](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/1236)).

Many thanks to ShivaPSOBB for making Lucina, the best girl, real in a very cool game.

You can drag and drop the source folders (pl226 or S_Swd059) onto the batch file directly or manually enter whether it be armor or sword.

Features:
- Extensive error handling because it was fun to do.
- Automated copy.
- Log file in case there was actually someone with issues and cares to get it fixed.
- Brain loss.
- Lucina is best girl, very cute.
